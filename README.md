**IBEM Overview**

IBEM is a compact Solar System IoT Battery Energy Monitor, which can accurately measure up to 200A peak DC, nominally 100A continuous, complete with voltage and power monitoring.

Based on the new Espressif ESP32C3 Mini, which has both WiFi and BT, the SDK board is provided with a in-built bi-directional DC current sensor, via M8 bolt terminals, into a 16-bit ADS1115 four channel ADC. 

Using the on-board 4.5 to 80V DC-DC SMPS, the board can easily be safely powered direct from the battery source - an also continually monitor the battery voltage.

Interface for programming, and development, is thought the standard Type C USB, into the on-board ESP32C3 DevKit port.  So making development completely self-contained.

Further information to follow.
