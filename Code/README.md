**IBEM ESP32C3 IoT Battery Energy Monitor SDK**

------------

This folder contains IBEM Example Source Code.

  The purpose of the test code is to cycle through the various main functions of the board, as shown below, as part of board bring up testing.

  PlatformIO code will automaticlaly load required libraries and configure board.   See platformio.ini for information,

  Remember!
  - Set the BOARD to ESP32-C3 DEV MODULE (or similar).
  - You may set the BAUD rate to 921600 to speed up flashing.
  - The SDK does NOT need external power to flash and will take Power from the USB 5V.
  
  This test code is OPEN SOURCE and formatted for easier viewing.  Although is is not intended for real world use, it may be freely used, or modified as needed.
