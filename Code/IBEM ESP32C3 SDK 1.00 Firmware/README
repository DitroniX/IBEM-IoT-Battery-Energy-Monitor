  PCA 1.2403-10x - Test Code Firmware v1 - 8th April 2024

  The purpose of this test code is to cycle through the various main functions of the board, as shown below, as part of board bring up testing.

  Simplified Board Bring Up Test - All Functions
  
  Note: Global.h contains various user configurable variables.

  Remember!
  Set the BOARD to ESP32-C3 DEV MODULE (or similar).
  You may set the BAUD rate to 921600 to speed up flashing.
  The SDK does NOT need external power to flash and will take Power from the USB 5V.
